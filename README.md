A real world implementation of an extendable Money object using integers of smallest currency unit as calculation.

This library was created because other existing solutions had one or more of the following drawbacks:
- missing extendability of Money class
- dependency on fixed currency class
- missing methods like format and convertTo currency
- errors in implementation that caused to have rounding errors and missing cents in e.g. summing up prices
- library not being maintained anymore

Free to use. Use it or leave it.
